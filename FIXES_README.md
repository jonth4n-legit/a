# Cloud Skills Boost Lab Automation - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

This update resolves several critical issues that were preventing the lab automation from working properly:

### 1. ✅ NameError: 'random_string' is not defined
**Problem**: The `random_string` function was defined locally inside `create_chrome_driver` but called globally in `start_lab`.
**Solution**: Moved `random_string` function to global scope at module level.

### 2. ✅ CSS Selector Failures 
**Problem**: Firefox Relay UI changes caused the selector `"button.MaskCard_copy-button__a7PXh samp"` to fail.
**Solution**: Added multiple fallback selectors and regex-based email extraction:
- Multiple CSS selector variations
- Regex pattern matching for email extraction  
- Fallback to searching elements containing '@' symbol

### 3. ✅ Chrome Driver Stability Issues
**Problem**: "DevToolsActivePort file doesn't exist" and "session not created" errors.
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive Chrome options for stability
- Improved retry logic with process cleanup
- Better profile management
- Added Chrome process cleanup functionality

### 4. ✅ GUI Compatibility
**Problem**: Script failed in headless environments due to tkinter dependency.
**Solution**: Made GUI imports conditional with fallback for headless operation.

## Usage

### GUI Mode (when available)
```bash
python main.py
```

### CLI Mode
```bash
python main.py --cli
```

### Test Mode
```bash
python main.py --test
```

### Validate Fixes
```bash
python test_fixes.py
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better retry logic and error reporting
2. **Robust Email Extraction**: Multiple fallback methods for Firefox Relay
3. **Chrome Stability**: Comprehensive Chrome options and process management
4. **Cross-platform Support**: Works in both GUI and headless environments
5. **Better Logging**: Improved log messages for debugging

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Chrome browser
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Files Modified

- `main.py`: Main application with all fixes applied
- `test_fixes.py`: Comprehensive test suite to validate fixes
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies (unchanged)

The automation should now work reliably without the previous errors.
